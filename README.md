# Breast-Cancer-Detection

This project uses demonstrates detecting Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, sometimes called infiltrating ductal carcinoma, which is the most common type of breast cancer. About 80% of all breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas. This type of cancer develops in a milk duct and invades the fibrous or fatty breast tissue outside the duct. 

Weâ€™ll use the IDC_regular dataset (the breast cancer histology image dataset). Histology is the study of micrsocopic study of tissues.

*This project is currently a work in progress.
